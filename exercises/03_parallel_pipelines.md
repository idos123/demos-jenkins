The idea behind this exercise is to run pipelines in parallel.

* Change your Jenkinfile to have several pipelines running in parallel.

* Remember that the number of your executors is 2 so have more than 2 pipeline allowed
	to run in parallel.

* Have a few stages in each of the pipelines (to simulate a real work complex project)

* Install (or check that it's already installed) the ocean-ui plugin to visualize the
	parallel execution (Not a must, nice to have)

* For the time, still use the "any" executor.
