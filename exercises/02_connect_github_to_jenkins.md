The idea of this exercise is that every push to
your github repo will cause jenkins to rerun your pipeline.

You will have to confiure this at BOTH ENDS.
	* configure github to send notifications to your jenkins when the source code changes.
	* configure jenkins to respond to such notifications by running the pipeline.

* you can find plenty of guides on how to configure both github and jenkins.
