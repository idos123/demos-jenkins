Options:
- create my own jenkins image which is based on the official jenknis
	image and adds python+pip+pytest+...
- look for a plugin (very suspicious)
- docker exec
	add the stuff we need to the running jenkins containr
	UGLY!!!
	Need to repeat every time we a new jenkins container.
- Add stages to install everything we need. 
	May not work! because jenkins runs as user 1000 and not user 0 (root).
	Could work, just not in this case.

All of these options are suspect... None of them is really good.
