This is the vova method...:)

- open a mobaXterm terminal
- know where your pem file is
- run
	ssh -i [where your pem file is] -f -N ubuntu@[your remote ip] -L 9081:[your remote ip]:8080
- this command maps localhost:9081 to [your remote ip]:8080
- open a local browser on your windows machine and point it to:
	localhost:9081

Enjoy!
